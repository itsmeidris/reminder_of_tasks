# notification_app

A new Flutter project.


1️⃣ Core MVP Features

Task creation (title, time, frequency).
Local notifications (triggered at set times).
Daily checklist to mark tasks as done.
Simple progress tracking (e.g., streaks, % completed).

2️⃣ Future Enhancements (if MVP works well)

Habit streaks (visual progress).
Categories (health, work, study, personal).
Cloud sync (so users don’t lose data).
Social/competitive features (friends, challenges).

AI suggestions (e.g., propose habits).

3️⃣ Tech Approach in Flutter

Local notifications: Use flutter_local_notifications.
Data storage: Start with sqflite or hive (local DB).
State management: Provider or GetX (you’ve used both).
UI: Simple task list + progress bar + streak calendar.
